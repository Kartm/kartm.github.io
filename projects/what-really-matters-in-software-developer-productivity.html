It might be caused by the fact that junior developers have well-defined tasks, whereas senior developers usually have very vast tasks across many moving parts.</p><p>With increased expertise, many experienced developers set a higher standard for defining a task as &quot;done&quot;, introducing a possible self-critical bias when answering the survey.</p><p>Senior team members frequently wear multiple hats: mentoring, product coordination, production support. These extra responsibilities might cause additional overhead, delaying their own coding tasks and leading to missed deadlines.</p><p>Overall, this does not necessarily imply that senior developers are less productive. Rather it suggests they may face more complex challenges, as one senior respondent noted in a separate comment:</p><blockquote>
<p>A few days&#x27; delay on a major architectural change may feel more serious than a small missed deadline on an isolated ticket.</p>
