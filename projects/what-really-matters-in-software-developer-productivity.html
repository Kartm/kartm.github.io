<article class="article-content"><h1>What really matters in software developer productivity: a 105-dev survey</h1><h2>1. Introduction</h2><p>I found advice on dev productivity often anecdotal, so I performed a survey to see first-hand what has a real impact on developer productivity.</p><p>I used <a href="https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3454124">SPACE framework</a> to view productivity with a multidimensional take:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Satisfaction</strong>: Understanding developers&#x27; well-being is crucial because stress, lack of recognition, or poor work-life balance can negatively affect productivity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Performance</strong>: Evaluating how well developers meet goals and deadlines provides insight into whether existing tools and processes are effectively supporting them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Activity</strong>: Understanding how daily tasks are managed helps highlight bottlenecks and time-wasting activities that can reduce productivity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Communication</strong>: Effective teamwork and communication are essential in software development. Problems in collaboration can lead to delays, misaligned goals, or rework.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Efficiency</strong>: How smoothly developers can complete tasks without disruptions. Interruptions, long wait times for code reviews, or the burden of technical debt can reduce flow, making it harder for developers to stay productive.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>In late 2024 I have conducted a <strong>10-week-long survey on 105 developers</strong> recruited from social media platforms (e.g., LinkedIn, Reddit), professional forums (e.g., HackerNews), and various software development communities. This allowed me to capture a wide range of backgrounds, including differences in experience level, technology stacks, team sizes, and organizational types.</p><p><img alt="Respondent age group distribution" title="Respondent age group distribution" loading="lazy" width="1200" height="800" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent;width:100%;height:auto" src="/media/media/image39.svg"/></p><p>More than 77% participants were under the age of 35, indicating that the survey mostly reached a <strong>relatively young</strong> segment of the industry. Age can influence familiarity with technologies and preferences for communication styles.</p><p><img alt="Respondent gender distribution" title="Respondent gender distribution" loading="lazy" width="1200" height="800" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent;width:100%;height:auto" src="/media/media/image13.png"/></p><p>Around 85% respondents were male.</p><p>Female respondents accounted for around 12% of the responses. According to <a href="https://www.developernation.net/developer-reports/dn25/">SlashData&#x27;s 2023 Developer Nation survey</a> performed on 8380 developers, the share of female developers oscillates around 23% globally, indicating that this study might base on a sample that&#x27;s underrepresenting the female part of the industry, therefore performing analysis between genders would make little sense and possibly introduce bias.</p><div class="markdown-alert markdown-alert-important"><p class="markdown-alert-title"><svg class="octicon octicon-report mr-2" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden="true"><path d="M0 1.75C0 .784.784 0 1.75 0h12.5C15.216 0 16 .784 16 1.75v9.5A1.75 1.75 0 0 1 14.25 13H8.06l-2.573 2.573A1.458 1.458 0 0 1 3 14.543V13H1.75A1.75 1.75 0 0 1 0 11.25Zm1.75-.25a.25.25 0 0 0-.25.25v9.5c0 .138.112.25.25.25h2a.75.75 0 0 1 .75.75v2.19l2.72-2.72a.749.749 0 0 1 .53-.22h6.5a.25.25 0 0 0 .25-.25v-9.5a.25.25 0 0 0-.25-.25Zm7 2.25v2.5a.75.75 0 0 1-1.5 0v-2.5a.75.75 0 0 1 1.5 0ZM9 9a1 1 0 1 1-2 0 1 1 0 0 1 2 0Z"></path></svg>Important</p><p>The survey sample is skewed towards young (~77% under 35), male (~85%), and more experienced developers; juniors and women are under-represented.</p>
</div><p><img alt="Respondent job role distribution" title="Respondent job role distribution" loading="lazy" width="1200" height="800" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent;width:100%;height:auto" src="/media/media/image34.png"/></p><p>Around 86% of respondents reported being directly involved in development and engineering. Another 8% were also involved, but on a higher level (conceptual work, architecture and technical leadership). Remaining 6% were site administrators, support engineers or other roles.</p><p><img alt="Respondent primary expertise area vs work experience level distribution" title="Respondent primary expertise area vs work experience level distribution" loading="lazy" width="1200" height="800" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent;width:100%;height:auto" src="/media/media/image25.png"/></p><p>I have reached developers with wide ranges of experience levels, useful factor to compare later. Expertise areas were a multi-choice field. Most frequent choices are back-end &amp; front-end development and DevOps, and were predominantly made by developers having more than 2 years of experience in the industry. Developers with <strong>less experience seem to be significantly underrepresented</strong>, therefore it wouldn&#x27;t make sense to analyze junior developers in the survey.</p><p><img alt="Respondent-reported project scale distribution" title="Respondent-reported project scale distribution" loading="lazy" width="1200" height="800" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent;width:100%;height:auto" src="/media/media/image5.png"/></p><p>Only 6% of respondents report to work in simple projects (involving predictable tasks, few dependencies, and straightforward requirements).</p><p>Project scale impacts the complexity and types of challenges teams face, with larger projects requiring more coordination and resources.</p><p><img alt="Respondent team and workplace size distribution" title="Respondent team and workplace size distribution" loading="lazy" width="1200" height="800" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent;width:100%;height:auto" src="/media/media/image3.png"/></p><p>34% of participants are engaged in small teams of 3 to 5 members, while 44% operate within medium-sized teams consisting of 6 to 15 members. Making a comparison between these two team sizes is an opportunity to understand how team composition influences other measured factors.</p><h2>2. Work environment vs job satisfaction</h2><p>Work environment is not only the physical space where developers work (remote, on-site, hybrid). It also includes the mental environment: team culture, motivation factors, stress levels.</p><p>First, to compare work environments (remote, hybrid, on-site), appropriate scales were introduced so that <strong>higher values == &quot;better&quot;</strong>.</p><p><img alt="Radar plot comparing satisfaction of remote, hybrid, and on-site respondents" title="Radar plot comparing satisfaction of remote, hybrid, and on-site respondents" loading="lazy" width="1200" height="800" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent;width:100%;height:auto" src="/media/media/image28.png"/></p><p>Hybrid developers often report more frequent achievement recognition, whereas on-site developers seem to suffer more frequently from impostor syndrome yet report lower stress overall, suggesting social interaction might reduce stress but also provoke negative self-assessment.</p><p>Summarizing by calculating the area of respective polygons indicates that hybrid developers generally report better well-being than on-site developers:</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Environment</strong></th><th><strong>Area</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Hybrid</td><td>31.6</td></tr><tr><td>Remote</td><td>29.0</td></tr><tr><td>On-site</td><td>27.2</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Some open answers reveal that an in-office environment sets <strong>better boundaries between personal and professional life</strong>, and remote workers often find it hard to &quot;switch off&quot;, as one respondent notes:</p><blockquote>
<p>If you&#x27;re not careful, working at home means you never truly leave &#x27;the office.&#x27;</p>
</blockquote><p>Other respondents cite the need for better recognition and manager appreciation:</p><blockquote>
<p>[...] how do we give the work done by developers the appropriate value and reward? I think that would improve productivity greatly.</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p>Who the developer is matters more than anything. Want more productive people? Show them they matter to you. Treat people well and get out of their way.</p>

</div><p>There are even more differences in how developers experience remote-only work.</p><p>Remote teams enjoy flexibility and asynchronous work but risk more alignment calls, digital interruptions, and self-discipline hurdles. Onsite/hybrid teams benefit from rapid in-person collaboration yet face noise and social intrusions.</p><h2>3. Planning, deployment and developer productivity</h2><p>Let&#x27;s see how developers perceive their own momentum and ability to deliver on time.</p><p><img alt="Distribution of frequencies of developers meeting their deadlines" title="Distribution of frequencies of developers meeting their deadlines" loading="lazy" width="1200" height="800" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent;width:100%;height:auto" src="/media/media/image22.png"/></p><p>On average, participants manage to deliver mostly on time.</p><p><img alt="Distribution of frequencies of developers meeting their deadlines by developer experience level" title="Distribution of frequencies of developers meeting their deadlines by developer experience level" loading="lazy" width="1200" height="800" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent;width:100%;height:auto" src="/media/media/image23.png"/></p><p>Surprisingly, the average self-reported deadline meeting frequency slightly decreases with experience. It might be caused by the fact that junior developers have well-defined tasks, whereas senior developers usually have very vast tasks across many moving parts.</p><p>With increased expertise, many experienced developers set a higher standard for defining a task as &quot;done&quot;, introducing a possible self-critical bias when answering the survey.</p><p>Senior team members frequently wear multiple hats: mentoring, product coordination, production support. These extra responsibilities might cause additional overhead, delaying their own coding tasks and leading to missed deadlines.</p><p>Overall, this does not necessarily imply that senior developers are less productive. Rather it suggests they may face more complex challenges, as one senior respondent noted in a separate comment:</p><blockquote>
<p>A few days&#x27; delay on a major architectural change may feel more serious than a small missed deadline on an isolated ticket.</p>
</blockquote><p><img alt="Average deadline-reaching frequency by obstacle type" title="Average deadline-reaching frequency by obstacle type" loading="lazy" width="1200" height="800" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent;width:100%;height:auto" src="/media/media/image15.png"/></p><p>Developers lacking resources and developers complaining about unclear requirements were the group least effective in reaching deadlines. Let&#x27;s explore this by comparing team sizes.</p><p><img alt="Distribution of deadline-reaching obstacles by team size" title="Distribution of deadline-reaching obstacles by team size" loading="lazy" width="1200" height="800" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent;width:100%;height:auto" src="/media/media/image18.png"/></p><p>Scope creep appears universal across all team sizes, highlighting that no matter how large the team is, changing requirements and additional features remain a main threat to on-time delivery.</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Smallest teams</strong>: often cite a lack of resources (e.g., insufficient team members or missing tools) as a primary reason for missing deadlines. Most likely each individual wears multiple hats, and any absence of expertise or tooling can cause major bottlenecks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mid-sized teams</strong> (3–15 members) show a more balanced distribution of obstacles, with scope creep and unclear requirements being consistently present. They typically have enough staff to handle various tasks but may face communication overhead or shifting priorities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Very large teams</strong> (31+ members) also report lack of resources, which might seem counterintuitive at first. A possible explanation is that in big organizations, specialized resources are sometimes tied to specific departments, or bureaucratic processes slow down obtaining the right tools or staff.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><img alt="Distribution of deadline-reaching obstacles by workplace size " title="Distribution of deadline-reaching obstacles by workplace size " loading="lazy" width="1200" height="800" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent;width:100%;height:auto" src="/media/media/image10.png"/></p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Very small workplaces</strong> (fewer than 10 employees) frequently struggle with unclear requirements and rapid pivoting, which can make hitting deadlines more challenging. Their focus on speed and experimentation might overshadow formal planning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Medium-sized workplaces</strong> tend to have more stable processes, so they rather report scope creep or internal dependencies instead of constant requirement changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Larger enterprises</strong> show a spread of different challenges: some mention hidden complexity in legacy systems. Even though they have more established procedures, the slow decision-making and multiple layers of management can slow progress.</p>

Instead, coordination, clarity of requirements, and resource availability seem to matter more than raw headcount.</p><p><img alt="Distribution of deadline-reaching frequencies by workplace size " title="Distribution of deadline-reaching frequencies by workplace size " loading="lazy" width="1200" height="800" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent;width:100%;height:auto" src="/media/media/image29.png"/></p><p>Smallest workplaces are the most prone to missing deadlines, likely because they rely on quick pivots, minimal processes, and sometimes underdeveloped planning strategies. One survey respondent captured this perfectly:</p><blockquote>
<p>I would start by improving the management, making it mandatory for them to be organized and to give requirements in a planned way. [...]</p>
</blockquote><p>Some big organizations still cope with heavy bureaucracy that can slow delivery, despite having more resources. As one respondent from a large workplace notes:</p><blockquote>
<p>&quot;Less bureaucracy in a large company.&quot;</p>
</blockquote><h3>4. The impact of CI/CD</h3><p><img alt="Distribution of usage of automated testing and automated deployment among developers" title="Distribution of usage of automated testing and automated deployment among developers" loading="lazy" width="1200" height="800" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent;width:100%;height:auto" src="/media/media/image40.png"/></p><p>Comments from respondents suggest that manual steps create extra stress and slow the momentum of each release. However, it&#x27;s not always possible to fully automate everything. Some teams deal with hardware dependencies or environment constraints that make continuous delivery hard. But for pure software teams, many see automation as a major boost to daily productivity.</p><p><img alt="Distribution of deployment times among respondents" title="Distribution of deployment times among respondents" loading="lazy" width="1200" height="800" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent;width:100%;height:auto" src="/media/media/image20.png"/></p><p>Most respondents can deploy changes in under 30 minutes, but around 30% mention they need an hour or more. Developers with longer deployment times often mention manual checks and gating processes, leading to decreased velocity.</p><p><img alt="Distribution of deployment times among respondents who automate the process vs those who don&#x27;t" title="Distribution of deployment times among respondents who automate the process vs those who don&#x27;t" loading="lazy" width="1200" height="800" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent;width:100%;height:auto" src="/media/media/image7.png"/></p><p>Teams with automated deployment show a slightly faster average deployment time. While automation alone might not fix every bottleneck (e.g. compliance processes), generally those with automation in place achieve quicker, more predictable releases.</p><div class="markdown-alert markdown-alert-important"><p class="markdown-alert-title"><svg class="octicon octicon-report mr-2" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden="true"><path d="M0 1.75C0 .784.784 0 1.75 0h12.5C15.216 0 16 .784 16 1.75v9.5A1.75 1.75 0 0 1 14.25 13H8.06l-2.573 2.573A1.458 1.458 0 0 1 3 14.543V13H1.75A1.75 1.75 0 0 1 0 11.25Zm1.75-.25a.25.25 0 0 0-.25.25v9.5c0 .138.112.25.25.25h2a.75.75 0 0 1 .75.75v2.19l2.72-2.72a.749.749 0 0 1 .53-.22h6.5a.25.25 0 0 0 .25-.25v-9.5a.25.25 0 0 0-.25-.25Zm7 2.25v2.5a.75.75 0 0 1-1.5 0v-2.5a.75.75 0 0 1 1.5 0ZM9 9a1 1 0 1 1-2 0 1 1 0 0 1 2 0Z"></path></svg>Important</p><p>Basic CI/CD (builds, tests, deploy) is linked with shorter and more predictable releases.

</div><h2>5. Time spent on coding vs meeting deadlines</h2><p>A common assumption in software development projects is that more daily time spent coding or testing automatically leads to higher on-time delivery. Although it&#x27;s widely accepted that &quot;too many meetings&quot; can decrease coding time, little quantitative research directly links self-reported coding/testing hours to self-reported ability to deliver on time.</p><p>Does dedicating a larger proportion of the workday to core development tasks (e.g., coding, testing) correlate with meeting project deadlines more frequently?</p><p><img alt="Distribution of primary workday tasks among developers" title="Distribution of primary workday tasks among developers" loading="lazy" width="1200" height="800" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent;width:100%;height:auto" src="/media/media/image36.png"/></p><p>As we can see, most developers are focused on discovery and coding, then testing and documentation during their workdays.</p><p><img alt="Distribution of mean deadline-reaching frequency among developers spending different times on personal duties" title="Distribution of mean deadline-reaching frequency among developers spending different times on personal duties" loading="lazy" width="1200" height="800" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent;width:100%;height:auto" src="/media/media/image31.png"/></p><p>No strong correlation appeared between coding/testing hours and meeting deadlines. Perhaps some teams meet deadlines despite limited coding time (due to simpler tasks or flexible deadlines), while others with long coding time still struggle when tasks are complex or deadlines are strict.</p><p><img alt="Distribution of deadline-reaching frequencies among developers spending different times on obligatory meetings on a weekly basis" title="Distribution of deadline-reaching frequencies among developers spending different times on obligatory meetings on a weekly basis" loading="lazy" width="1200" height="800" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent;width:100%;height:auto" src="/media/media/image6.png"/></p><p>Developers spending less than 15 minutes on obligatory meetings (e.g. daily meetings) report reaching deadlines less often on average.

<li>
<p><strong>Microsoft Teams</strong> seems to be the leader in big corporations, probably because these companies already use the Microsoft Office suite, so it&#x27;s a natural choice to opt in with Teams for additional integrations as they are already deep into the ecosystem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Slack</strong> seems to be less popular with the biggest companies, and is rather a choice for mid-sized companies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Google Chat</strong> has a considerable user base in large companies, most likely due to being in the Google Workspace suite, but it remains the least popular of the &quot;big three&quot;.</p>

Developer workflows are a big plus thanks to integrations with GitHub/GitLab, slash commands.</p><p>Some respondents however noted its limited impact on efficiency: one respondent noted Slack &quot;has never had an effect on my efficiency&quot;, calling it simply &quot;functional&quot;. Some see Slack just as an alternative to other platforms.</p><h3>Microsoft Teams</h3><p>People appreciate how Teams syncs with Outlook, corporate auth (AD/SSO), and the Office ecosystem and how calendar, calls, and chat are consolidated in one place to avoid distractions.</p><p>It has received negative feedback for being resource-heavy &amp; bloated: several respondents called it &quot;slow&quot;, &quot;clunky&quot; or prone to random sign-outs, buggy screen-sharing issues. Teams forced to migrate from Slack reported negative morale and &quot;cumbersome integration capabilities&quot; compared to Slack.</p><h3>Google Chat</h3><p>Praised for being lightweight &amp; quick to setup. Minimal clutter, easy adoption, and low friction if you already use Gmail or Google Docs. Perfect for basic messaging: fine for smaller teams or simple chats. Meeting links or simple file-sharing are quick.</p><p>It has its limitations and is missing advanced features: lacks powerful slash commands or robust thread management. In some cases accessibility is subpar: browser/extension incompatibilities, especially for text-based browsing.</p><p><img alt="Impact of work environment on efficiency by communication tool" title="Impact of work environment on efficiency by communication tool" loading="lazy" width="1200" height="800" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent;width:100%;height:auto" src="/media/media/image32.png"/></p><p>Looking at how respondents evaluate their overall work environment (e.g., workplace satisfaction, perceived productivity, and clarity of tasks), Slack and Google Chat users display fairly similar, positive ratings of their environment.

</div><h2>7. Can code reviews affect well-being of developers?</h2><p>Peer code reviews are a common practice in software development teams. It&#x27;s a means of finding errors and logical mistakes.</p><p>However, extended review cycles can delay merges, especially in busy teams. Prolonged branches or unresolved pull requests risk creating &quot;merge hell&quot;, which can lead to massive delays, potentially increasing technical debt.</p><p>Let&#x27;s discover the impact of code review processes on developers.</p><p><img alt="Distribution of code review wait times" title="Distribution of code review wait times" loading="lazy" width="1200" height="800" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent;width:100%;height:auto" src="/media/media/image27.png"/></p><p>Respondents can be categorized depending on how long they wait for code reviews:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Delayed</strong>: those who reported typically waiting more than 1 day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fast</strong>: those who typically wait 1 day or less.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>1 day is a practical cut-off to distinguish quick-feedback reviews from those that might disrupt flow and create bottlenecks.</p><p>Additionally, developers were grouped based on the perceived impact of receiving code reviews.</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Helpful</strong>: ratings of 4 or 5 (positive).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Unhelpful</strong>: ratings of 1, 2, or 3.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Each respondent was assigned to one of these four groups based on their survey answers about wait time and perceived impact. This categorization allows us to compare whether these groups systematically differ.</p><p><img alt="Mean well-being categories by code review group" title="Mean well-being categories by code review group" loading="lazy" width="1200" height="800" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent;width:100%;height:auto" src="/media/media/image21.png"/></p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Highest stress</strong>: <em>Unhelpful &amp; Delayed</em>. When feedback is late and of poor quality, developers report feeling blocked and undervalued, aligning with the hypothesis that such conditions intensify stress.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lowest stress</strong>: <em>Helpful &amp; Delayed</em>. Surprisingly, even though reviews come late, if the feedback is eventually constructive and collaborative, participants often report being less stressed. Perhaps these developers work in an environment with flexible deadlines or more empathetic management—so even a delayed review is not perceived as a severe bottleneck.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lowest recognition</strong>: Tends to cluster in the <em>Unhelpful &amp; Fast</em> group. This suggests that such feedback is rushed, consists of purely checking boxes and rarely involves praise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Higher recognition</strong>: <em>Helpful</em> groups (whether prompt or delayed) generally reported feeling more appreciated. Good feedback promotes a sense of support and achievement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Worst impostor ratings</strong>: <em>Unhelpful &amp; Fast</em>. Despite getting quick feedback, if the reviews are not constructive or are purely &quot;nitpicky&quot;, developers might feel their work is constantly under scrutiny without providing actual support. This aligns with the idea that the quality of feedback matters deeply for confidence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mixed impostor syndrome results</strong>: <em>Unhelpful &amp; Delayed</em> also scores high on impostor syndrome but not the worst. Individual circumstances and other confounding variables (e.g., how the team interacts outside formal reviews) could account for the difference.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Timely and constructive feedback</strong>: several respondents noted that quick turnaround and thoughtful feedback boosts confidence. They feel that even small acknowledgments of good coding practices or improvements helps them grow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Collaborative approach</strong>: supportive, discussion-based review culture makes developers feel recognized and reduces impostor syndrome by showing that their work has real value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Learning opportunity</strong>: respondents who praised code reviews often viewed them as mentorship moments, where suggestions go beyond simple fixes to real skill-building.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Negative code-review experience</h3><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Prolonged wait times</strong>: these delays increase stress and force context-switching, undermining developers&#x27; flow and leaving them uncertain about the quality of their prior work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>&quot;Rubber-stamped&quot; reviews</strong>: such feedback leaves developers feeling underappreciated (lack of achievement acknowledgment) and provokes impostor syndrome, as they never receive substantial validation or guidance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Minimal praise, unclear expectations</strong>: respondents describe wanting to understand why something is correct or praiseworthy, not just a quick sign-off. In the absence of real insight, they are unsure about their competence.</p>
</li>

Due to the minimal number of junior respondents, we treat this as non-representative.</p><p>One junior-type respondent mentioned doing all code reviews solo, effectively receiving no peer input. Another, dealing with a <strong>very long</strong> wait, expressed frustration about a siloed environment where colleagues are unwilling to review.</p><p>Both examples confirm that &quot;long&quot; or &quot;fast&quot; reviews can become meaningless if genuine peer interaction is missing, complicating any numeric findings.</p><h3>Mid-level developers (3–6 years of experience)</h3><p>Mid-level devs appreciate code reviews less when forced to wait longer. <strong>Timeliness seems crucial</strong> to maintaining flow and momentum in their daily tasks.</p><p>Several respondents in this group reported fast reviews but described the feedback as unhelpful: describing the feedback as &quot;contradictory&quot;, &quot;purely nitpicking&quot;, or effectively nonexistent. This underscores that short wait times alone do not yield positive results if the review&#x27;s quality is poor.</p><h3>Senior developers (&gt;7 years of experience)</h3><p>More experienced developers tolerate slight delays (perhaps seeing them as a sign of extensiveness) but report a <strong>steep decline</strong> in perceived quality after a waiting for more than three days.</p><p>Some respondents indicated that very long waits often result in no actual review, or solely a neutral/box-ticking process. Another respondent reported a mismatch in team expertise, where they receive minimal feedback from junior colleagues.</p><h2>8. Tech debt: the balance between effort and impact</h2><p>Technical debt can be boiled down to the accumulated cost of <strong>suboptimal or quickly implemented</strong> code that can slow down future development. While technical debt is often introduced for temporary reasons (e.g. meeting short-term deadlines or rapidly prototyping), it slows development down if left unaddressed.

<p><strong>Legacy code &amp; poor documentation</strong>: many mention inherited undocumented systems that slow all tasks. Old code bases appear hard to work on, so each change risks new bugs or confusion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Insufficient time to address debt</strong>: being the only developer or working under tight deadlines leads to rare refactoring at best. Because no formal process or time is allocated, they only fix issues when absolutely necessary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lack of management support</strong>: some note that higher-level leaders do not care about code quality, prioritizing quick feature delivery instead. Over time, this approach worsens the code structure and forces developers to fight with messy parts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Chaotic or entangled modules</strong>: respondents describe multiple &quot;workarounds&quot; or severely &quot;entangled&quot; code paths, making any enhancement risky. Without stable foundations, even small tasks involve disproportionately high effort.</p>

<p><strong>Awareness of code hotspots</strong>: respondents emphasize that if you know which parts of the code are most affected by tech debt (<strong>&quot;hotspots&quot;</strong>), it is easier to address them on demand. Although not perfect, this strategy stops the worst side effects from unmaintained areas.</p>
